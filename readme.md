# JavaScript30
_Note: project is still in progress_

Completed solutions for the JavaScript 30 Day Challenge along with my own modifications.

I have created a webpage for each challenge [the links can be found below](#Project-Links). Some challenges came with an intuitive or already built design, but some proved to be more challening. 

For the future, I'd like to create a webpage where you can click through all of the exercises without having to return to github.
